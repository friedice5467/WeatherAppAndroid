# Android Weather App built in MAUI

First mobile app I created built in MAUI, just wanted to test out it's capabilities. Simple app that gets location data from the phone, calls a weather api, gets the data and displays the data.

Things TODO if I feel up to it: 
1.) Get location by zip code 
2.) Clean up UI
3.) Desktop friendly version?
